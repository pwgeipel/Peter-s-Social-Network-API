# Peter G. Social Network API

## Description

The following is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.  It employs `Express.js` for routing, a `MongoDB` database, `Moment`, and the `Mongoose ODM`.  `Postman` was used to create the seed data.

Additionally, a video demonstrating the functionality of this API on `Postman` may be found here:
